## Participants by Job Titles
![](img/training%20by%20job%20title.png){width=1000px}

## Participants by Use Case I

* Web-based catalogue for technologies
* Knowledge-based web service to provide information on heating and cooling technologies
* The project focuses on the biological annotation of cancer evolutionary dynamics, and will harness semantic annotation for 
    * minimizing concept ambiguity, 
    * linking our data to an external and evolving KB, like Wikidata, and 
    * making smarter and federated queries on a structured KB.
* Using healthcare records stored in an RDF triple store
* Analysing text documents, building ontologies to support natural language QA
* Automatically crawling and structuring data on performing arts websites in Canada to enable complex queries and export JSON-LD event entities for search engines.

## Participants by Use Case II
* Using of ontologies and inference for business processes/workflows
* A project similar to now.ontotext.com
* LOD projects
* Having a big set of linked data consisting of airborne and Open Street data of United Kingdom, I want to find the schools and the hospitals which are in a region with polluted air. Children and patients are the most vulnerable group of people and they should take care of the environment where they live in.
* Predictive maintenance of aircraft fleet based on a range of data sources


## Revenue
* Positive financial result for 2017 for online trainings
* Since materials from the online trainings are reused for client custom trainings, we do have good profit from the client trainings
* The financial result as of April 2018 is still negative however the incomes from May are not calculated yet and the balance should be good at the end


# Advertisment

## Channels for Attracting Users I
* Email - the main conversion point (which results in training registrations)
* Social Media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)

![](img/twitter_21-05.png){width=600px}

## Channels for Attracting Users II
* Ads (Google, KD Nuggets, DB Engines)

![](img/banner.png){width=800px}

# Follow-up
## Conversions to Opportunities
Currently, there are no formal open opportunities (closed won or closed lost) with participants from the training but we are in touch with several of them in relation to their ongoing projects, in which they implement GraphDB and/or some other relevant technology.

## Use Case 1: Gregory Saumier-Finch, [Culture Creates](http://www.culturecreates.com/)

* Culture Creates is a Canadian company that makes live events findable for voice powered search and AI powered virtual assistants, like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. It also wants to ensure that arts organizations will always be the digital authority of their own metadata.

* A PoC was presented earlier this year at a conference in Quebec City in Canada, focusing on Innovation in Culture. Part of the presentation was dedicated to showing how GraphDB works when filled with current performing arts events metadata. A couple of visualizations
based on SPARQL queries were also generated.

* Video (2:49): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WalOgD41kDE

## Use Case 2: Adam Wyner, University of Aberdeen

* Already presented
